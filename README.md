reddit-comment-analysis
=======================
I plan to evolve this simple python script using praw (http://praw.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) 
to count the number of replies to a thread and count the number of replies to comments on the thread to 
see if there exists a discrepancy between user behavior on different subreddits
